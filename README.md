A music release searching application utilising the MusicBrainz API (https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API), with cover art pulled from the Cover Art Archive API (https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Cover_Art_Archive/API).

Inspired by freeCodeCamp's OMDB movie searching app tutorial (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-movie-search-app-using-react-hooks-24eb72ddfaf7/).
